This work presents a comprehensive and robust machine learning-based approach for predicting vehicle insurance premiums and risks. The proposed approach leverages both supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to estimate premiums and risks for car insurance records. 

The features considered are highly correlated with premium prediction, such as annual mileage, driving experience, car price, cubic capacity, and vehicle year. Firstly, the risk is estimated using unsupervised learning for benchmark datasets by clustering the records according to their risk profiles. This step involves selecting a suitable clustering algorithm and parameter tuning for the chosen algorithm. 

Next, the premium is estimated using supervised learning for synthetic data for three car models namely Swift, Santro, and Scorpio from 2009 to 2020, and then building a predictive model to estimate premiums for new records. This step involves feature selection, engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. Several algorithms are employed, including Random Forest, Decision Tree, Regressor, MLP Regression, Ridge Regression, Linear Regression, XGBoost, Adaboost, SVM, and Lasso Regression. Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Adaboost have the most notable outcomes of these algorithms. To improve the accuracy of XGBoost, the Random Forest, Decision Tree regressor, and Adaboost output is likely to be piled into a single column. 

Finally, to enable more precise pricing, expected premiums are modified based on the predicted record risk. Furthermore, the proposed approach can be tailored to different insurance companies and markets and can be used to enhance existing pricing models and strategies. Additionally, the proposed approach can be used to identify potential new markets and identify and target customers with the highest risk profiles. 

This can be used by insurance companies to proactively identify and manage the risk profiles of their customers and to adjust customer premiums accordingly. The proposed approach enables insurance companies to gain valuable insights into their customerâ€™s risk profiles and premiums, allowing them to adjust their pricing models accordingly. This approach can help insurance companies optimize their pricing strategies, leading to more accurate pricing models and better customer service. The proposed approach can also help insurance companies identify new markets and target customers with the highest risk profiles. By doing so, insurance companies can better manage their risk and reduce their overall costs. In conclusion, this work develops a powerful solution to accurately predict car insurance premiums and risks and can be used to improve existing pricing models and strategies. 

This approach provides insurance companies with the necessary tools to identify new markets, target customers with the highest risk profiles, and optimize their pricing strategies. We achieved 80% accuracy on risk prediction and 77% accuracy on premium prediction Ultimately, this approach can help insurance companies lower their risk and costs and provide better customer service
